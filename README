Option Screener
    The purpose of the option screener is to look for Call options that 
    require very little upward movement in the underlying security in order 
    to turn a profit.

    The idea is to try to eliminate some of the risk involved in call option
    trading by selecting call options where the underlying issue does not
    require a significant upward movement in order to break even and (hopefully)
    make a profit. 

    The conservative focus on P/E ratio and yield is to eliminate stocks that 
    might be more volatile, with the idea being that a stock with a decent yield 
    is probably not going to have a huge loss in the call expiration period. 
    This is, of course, just a superfical argument, and the yield and P/E can be
    adjusted with command line arguments.
