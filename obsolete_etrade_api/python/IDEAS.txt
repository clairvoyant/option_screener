    circuit breaker script
        Find low cost 'put' options that pay out tremendously on a 5% loss
        The purpose of this is to find a way to protect yourself from a total 
        market collapse For example, buy 20x $0.10 puts on something pretty 
        volatile that would react poorly to bad market, national or global news. 
        The hope is that these puts are never executed, but if the entire 
        market tanks, then these calls would pay off tremendously, covering any
        losses from market collapse. This is entirely theoretical, there might
        not be any puts that even come close to the parameters required to make
        this viable. 
           
        How the math would work: the calls would have to be well below the 
        current quote for the issue (maybe 5%) and the cost would have to be no
        more than $0.20 so that buying 10 of them would result in a cost of less
        than $200. The time frame would be 30 to 60 days out. At 10% drop in the
        issue would have to pay out roughly the same as the total amount in call
        options that the user has in the market at any given time. 

        Example:    
            A user is speculating with $2000 in options. For $200, the user buys
            10x $0.20 calls. The 10x puts would have to be able to pay out 
            around $2000 on a 10% drop. The script would attempt to find 'puts'
            that meet this criteria. 


    Overvalued screener
        Find put options in companies that do not have earnings at all. These
        companies should be significantly 'up' in the last few months and might
        be vulnerable to bad news and drop 2% or 3%. The script would find the
        put options for companies with less than stellar financials, have been
        pushed higher in recent weeks and are pretty volatile. The puts must 
        break even on a 2% loss. A 3% loss in the underlying issue should yield
        a 50% gain on the 'put' option.


    Earnings dissapointment screener
        Find short term put options for companies that are reporting earnings
        between the current date and the put expiration date. The idea is that
        if the company misses earnings, or lowers guidance, they get crushed
        (maybe unfairly) on the following day. This is the time to exercise the
        put and cash out. These maybe should be under $0.50 each and would pay
        out a bunch with a 3% loss on the underlying issue. The low cost allows
        for extending leverage with limited exposure, and the short time frame
        limits the chance that some sort of excellent news drives the price up.
        The purchaser of these puts, however, should be prepared for these
        options to expire worthless.

        The most recent (Sept 2017) earnings announcement for Oracle was my
        inspiration for this. They beat street estimates, but then lowered 
        guidance, falling from near $53/share to $48/share (almost 10%). 
        Assuming a $2 loss (4%) could be obtained for $0.20 each, then buying
        5 of these puts would have returned something like $1500 on a $100
        investment. That is a $3.00 additional loss times 5 puts, for $1500.

        I don't love the idea of betting against companies, but it could be a
        low risk way to build some capital during earnings season.
