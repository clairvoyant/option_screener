Option Screener
    The purpose of the option screener is to look for Call options that 
    require very little upward movement in the underlying security in order 
    to turn a profit.

    The idea is to try to eliminate some of the risk involved in call option
    trading by selecting call options where the underlying issue does not
    require a significant upward movement in order to break even and (hopefully)
    make a profit. 

    The conservative focus on P/E ratio and yield is to eliminate stocks that 
    might be more volatile, with the idea being that a stock with a decent yield 
    is probably not going to have a huge loss in the call expiration period. 
    This is, of course, just a superfical argument, and the yield and P/E can be
    adjusted with command line arguments.

In The Money Covered Call Screner - itm_cc_screener.py
    This script will find covered calls to purchase that have a fat time
    value. This will give a limited pay out, but in a short amount of
    time and with limited risk to the downside.

    The idea here is to execute a Buy/Write covered call with a 
    "deep in the money" strike price. This virtually guarantees that
    the option will be exercised. The potential gain is all tied up in the
    "time value" of the call option. The time value is the difference 
    between the price, the bid and the strike:
        time value = bid - ( price - strike )

    Example: AT&T (T) current price: 37.05, strike price 35.0, bid 2.48
        The total value of the call is the bid price (what someone will pay)
        The intrinsic value of the call is the difference between the 
        current price and the strike (37.05 - 35 = 2.05). Therefore, the
        remaining value of the call option is the bid minus the instrincic
        value (2.48 - 2.05 = 0.43). This example yields a $43 profit on
        a cost of $3457 (1.2% gain minus commissions), in a time period of
        about fix weeks in this example. 

    With a short turn around time, a 1% gain every six to eight
    weeks would yield approximately 6% to 9% annually. Additionally, if the 
    Ex-Dividend date falls between the current date and the expiration
    date, you might also pick up the dividend, if the option is not
    exercised until after the ex-dividend date, adding to the yield.
    Obviously, fetching 2% every six to eight weeks would higher a yield APY,
    in the neighborhood of 12% to 18%.

    The downside risk is also limited. The stock would have to fall below
    the cost basis (buy price minus option premium collected -- the bid). 
    This value is represented in the CSV as 'Loss%'. Typicall this should
    be higher than 10% to really limit the risk.

    Ideally, you're looking for something with a high Gain% and a high Loss%.
    Maybe Loss% is named poorly and should be something like "down side risk%".

    TODO - 
        - write to CSV
        - make minimum gain% and loss% command line arguments
        - calculate the days remaining for the call
        - calculate the % gain per day (a 1% call in 5 days trumps a 2% gain in 20 days)
            - this would help sorting
